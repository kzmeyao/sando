I prefer mountains to beaches, driving to flying. So when the idea of taking a roadtrip to Grand Teton National Park came up, I anticipated it like no other vacation before it. Although 15 hours is a really long time to spend in a car, even over the span of two days, it was worth seeing the Teton range jutting out in the horizon on the final leg of the drive. Like a metropolis skyline, the snow-covered peaks towered over the surrounding landscape. All of our travel weariness dissipated as the mountains got bigger and bigger, and we knew that an exciting adventure was waiting for us.

Our main event for this trip was a hike along the Cascade Canyon trail to Lake Solitude. We initially planned for a longer roundtrip trail that didn't require us to double-back, but we were definitely glad that we did not end up doing that. At the end of this hike, our limbs were starting to give up.
