I prefer mountains to beaches, driving to flying. So when the idea of taking a roadtrip to Grand Teton National Park came up, I anticipated it like no other vacation before it. Although 15 hours is a significant amount of time to spend in a car, it was worth seeing the Teton range jutting out in the horizon on the final leg of our drive. Like a metropolis skyline, the prominent peaks towered over the surrounding landscape. All of our travel weariness dissipated as the mountains got bigger and bigger, and we knew that an exciting adventure was waiting for us.

Our main event for this trip was a hike along the Cascade Canyon trail to Lake Solitude. We initially planned for a longer roundtrip trail that didn't require us to double-back, but we were definitely glad that we did not end up doing that. At the end of this hike, our limbs were starting to give up.

After a couple of miles, we get into the heart of the Cascade Canyon. Flanked by mountains on both sides, we felt as we were in our own little world.

As we trekked higher, the landscape around us began to transition from a summer green to a winter brown. Patches of snow appeared along the side of the trail. With another couple of steps, more patches. This continued for another mile or so until finally, a full-blown snowfield greeted us. The ground was white as far as my eyes could see. Lake Solitude, our intended destination, was still frozen over.

The wind was fierce at the lake. The sky constantly changed colors as clouds raced overhead. I feared for my camera and tripod setup falling over many times, but the hook attachment came in handy and I was able to weigh it down with my pack. Needless to say, I would've stayed a bit longer if not for the wind.

At the end of the trail, our legs were starting to give out underneath us. We had the choice of hiking two more miles around Jenny Lake to get to our car or to take a ferry directly across the lake. We opted for the latter. Not surprisingly, almost everyone else had the same idea and there was a huge line waiting for the ferry. It was not the triumphant fairytale ending we had hoped for, but we abided.

Over the next two days spent in Grand Teton, we were able to let our legs recover and let our car do all the work. There were some fantastic lookout spots and areas of historical significance to visit.

This national park is definitely something special. It exudes a natural beauty that matches some of the best in this country. It makes me want to wake up at 4am for the sunrise and bear the mosquito bites for the sunset, because when the lighting hits, it's just pure magic. Not to mention, the Cascade Canyon trail was also one of the best hikes I've done in a while. After these couple of days on the road, I'm still a mountains over beaches guy.
