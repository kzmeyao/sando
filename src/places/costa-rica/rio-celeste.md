> The ground was muddy from the sporadic rain. I carefully planned my steps to avoid the puddles. Although my clothes were already drenched and heavy from the rain water, my mind felt as light as ever from just having witnessed an incredible scene. The greens of the forest and the blues of the water came together harmoniously to form the perfect palette. No wonder the locals say _“when God finished painting the sky, he washed his brushes in the Rio Celeste”_.

Tucked in the Tenerio Volcanic National Park, the Rio Celeste river gets its distinctive turquoise color from a physical phenomenon rather than a chemical one. Two clear, upstream rivers come together to trigger an effect called Mie scattering, resulting in a spectacular optical illusion that tricks our eyes to see turquoise blue. It is such a wonderful shade of blue that before seeing the real deal, I initially thought online photos of the river must have been exaggerated.

Although the river is the namesake star here, the waterfall on premise is no slouch either. As we approached the fall, the verdent foliage formed a tunnel around the staircase descending to the fall, making it quite the dramatic entrance. As we were standing on the bank, there were even glasswing butterflies flying about with their transparent wings, giving off a fairytale-esque vibe. Someday, if I ever put together a list of my favorite waterfalls, this one would be near the very top.

Further along the trail, there were various other features that made the hike thoroughly enjoyable. One section of the river formed the _Laguna Azul_, an intensely blue lagoon. Another section of the river has geothermal activity, where we got a good whiff of sulfur and saw bubbles gushing out from under the surface of the water. Last, but not least, at the end of the trail, we saw the actual convergence spot of the aforementioned two rivers. I imagine the whole sequence of following the river and then seeing the science in action would be similar to finding the pot of gold at the end of a rainbow. All in all, this gem of a place was definitely worth the slight off-roading and I hope the magic lives on for generations to come.
