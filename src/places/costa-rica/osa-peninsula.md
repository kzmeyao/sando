> I learned English from nature books. The first time I stepped into a public library after moving to the United States, I fell in love with the nature section. The photographs of lush jungles and exotic animals overwhelmed me and I found myself spellbound by evolution and biodiversity. Therefore, I have always wanted to visit Costa Rica, a country consisting of a staggering 5% of the world’s biodiversity. After researching for the trip and happening upon a remote destination called the Osa Peninsula, I just had to pack my bags and visit _"the most biological intense place on Earth"_.

Every perception of color is an illusion. We do not see colors as they really are. In our perception they alter one another. In order to use color effectively it is necessary to recognize that color deceives continually. In visual perception a color is almost never seen as it really is — as it physically is. This fact makes color the most relative medium in art.
