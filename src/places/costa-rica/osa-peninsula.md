> I learned English from nature books. The first time I stepped into a public library after moving to the United States, I fell in love with the nature section. The photographs of lush jungles and exotic animals overwhelmed me and I found myself spellbound by evolution and biodiversity. Therefore, I have always wanted to visit Costa Rica, a country consisting of a staggering 5% of the world’s biodiversity. After researching for the trip and happening upon a remote destination called the Osa Peninsula, I just had to pack my bags and visit _"the most biological intense place on Earth"_.

While the peninsula is well-known for being home to a great abundance of wildlife, the peninsula is also home to Corcovado National Park, the crown jewel park of Costa Rica. Our trip, however, was not meant to be grueling or adventurous in a major way, so we instead opted to experience the peninsula through a more relaxing manner. We chose to stay at the neighboring ecolodge, Bosque del Cabo, which offered an unique accommodation option and fantastic food. Best of all, there were numerous well-maintained hiking trails of varying lengths that led us through pristine forests to beaches and waterfalls.

On every trail we hiked on, we were able to see animals we've never seen before. From witnessing extraordinarily blue morpho butterflies fluttering overhead to a pair of scarlet macaws feeding their slightly ruffled youngster, we realized just how wonderfully dense the wildlife population is here. Nature just seemed to show up in full force, **all the time**. I felt as if I were part of a _Planet Earth_ documentary, with interesting things unfolding effortlessly left and right, no matter where my eyes wandered to.

Of course, it's not only the visuals that were stimulating. The sounds were 50% of the experience. Whether it's day or night, the sound of the forest cupped around your ears. Even now, I can still vividly recall the first night in our _very_ open three-walled cabin. A storm had hit that night - supposedly the largest one the locals have seen in more than ten years. With no regard for the heavy rain or thunder, the forest came alive. A ragtag band of birds, frogs, insects and monkeys competed against one another and against the fury of nature. It was chaotic but oddly calming, and I loved every single minute of it.

Although our stay at the lodge was only for a couple of days, I am glad that I was able to bring my childhood dreams of trekking through the rainforest to life. Additionally, on the day of leaving the lodge, I was finally able to get a clear photograph of an elusive green and black poison dart frog I’ve tried to shoot multiple times on the path to our cabin. Talk about leaving on a high note.
