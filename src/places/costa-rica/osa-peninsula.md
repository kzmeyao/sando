> I learned English from nature books. The first time I stepped into a public library after moving to the United States, I fell in love with the nature section. The photographs of lush jungles and exotic animals overwhelmed me and I found myself spellbound by evolution and biodiversity. Therefore, I have always wanted to visit Costa Rica, a country consisting of a staggering 5% of the world’s biodiversity. After researching for the trip and happening upon a remote destination called the Osa Peninsula, I just had to pack my bags and visit _"the most biological intense place on Earth"_.

On top of being home to a great abundance of wildlife, the peninsula is also home to Corcovado National Park, the crown jewel park of Costa Rica. Our trip, however, was not meant to be grueling or adventurous in a major way, so we instead opted to experience the peninsula through a neighboring ecolodge, Bosque del Cabo. The lodge offered unique accommodation options and fantastic food. Best of all, there were numerous well-maintained hiking trails of varying lengths that led us through pristine forests to beaches and waterfalls.

On every trail we hiked on, we were able to see animals we've never seen before. From witnessing intensely blue morpho butterflies fluttering overhead to a pair of scarlet macaws feeding their slightly ruffled youngster, we realized just how wonderfully dense the wildlife is here. Nature just seemed show up in full force, **all the time**. I felt as if I were part of a documentary, with interesting things unfolding effortlessly left and right, no matter where my eyes wandered to.

Of course, it's not only the visuals that were stimulating. The sounds were 50% of the experience. Even today, I can still vividly recall the first night in our _very_ open three-walled cabin. A storm had hit that night - the largest one they've had in more than ten years. With no regard for the heavy rain and thunder, the forest came alive. A ragtag band of birds, monkeys, insects, and frogs competed against the fury of nature. It was chaotic but oddly calming, and I loved every single minute of it.

Although our stay at the lodge was only for a couple of days, and I was slightly sad that we had to go, I was finally able to get a clear photograph of an elusive green and black poison dart frog I’ve tried to shoot multiple times on the path to our cabin. Talk about leaving on a high note.
