**UNDER CONSTRUCTION**

> As I stepped out of the cramped bus, a light breeze blew past me and I immediately knew that there was something special in the air. A wave of serenity washed over me and I felt completely at peace. Maybe it was because we just escaped the hustle and bustle of Tokyo, or maybe it was because we were tired from all the traveling weâ€™ve done, but whatever it was, it formed an everlasting impression on me. Ever since then, I have had a fond memory of Kyoto.

Kyoto used to be Japan's capital for more than a thousand years, so it is without a doubt still a city deeply rooted in culture and tradition. Travelers expecting scenes of a traditional Japan, however, may at first be disappointed. After all, stepping out of Kyoto station and surveying the structures nearby, you are still very much looking at a modern city, not unlike what you would see in Tokyo. Give it a little more time and visit some of the quintessential landmarks though, you too will begin to feel the DNA of the former capital still resonating in the air.

First things first, there is one place you should not miss: Arashiyama. Despite all the tourists, this picturesque location has all the right ingredients for soothing the soul. Walking to the main river view is like walking straight into a painting. If your timing is right, you may even catch blooming sakura, which we unfortunately missed by two weeks or so. The area also consists of an eclectic mix of points of interest: the Sagano bamboo grove, the Iwatayama Monkey Park, the Tenryuji Buddhist temple, just to name the popular ones. The best decision we made was to stay overnight at an Airbnb in the area, so we were able to avoid the crowds earlier in the morning.

The second place in Kyoto that is highly regarded and should be at the top of the list is Kiyomizu-dera. This temple complex was a finalist for the _New7Seven Wonders of the World_ (not a spelling error). Although it did not ultimately get on the list, it is still quite an architectural marvel. Considering how large and tall the wooden main hall is, it was rather surprising to find out that the entire thing was built without a single nail. Outside the temple grounds and leading up to the temple itself is a street full of tourist-friendly vendors where you can do some souvenior shopping. Or if you have a sweet tooth like me, you can treat yourself to some dessert from the many confectionaries lined up along the way.

Aside from these two places I mentioned, there were a ton of other places we've enjoyed in Kyoto as well. I can definitely see myself coming back here during different seasons and taking in the beauty of this city again and again.
