> The land of vending machines. A concrete jungle blending the modern and the traditional. Tokyo, and Japan in general has long been on the top of my travel list. Something about the culture and how I grew up consuming massive amounts of Japanese media drew me in like a moth to a flame. Now, having finally visited, I am hooked for life.

Tokyo is one of the densest cities on Earth, yet with so many people, it is surprisingly orderly. Streets are almost completely void of trash cans, yet they remain clean. People are expected to carry their trash with them until they get home and I found myself stuffing onigiri and sandwich wrappers in my pockets on more than one occasion.

Speaking of onigiris and sandwiches, the convenience stores in Japan shine. Jam-packed with a huge selection of food and beverages at a great value, they are worth multiple visits. My go-to combination is the tuna mayo onigiri, the egg salad sando (namesake of this site), and a random eye-catching drink from the fridge section. The constant variety, seasonal flavors, and limited edition goods keep life interesting.

Aside from the super cheap convenience store eats, Tokyo is also full of great restaurants. Most of the time, you can simply just point to one and go instead of having to look up reviews ahead of time. The quality bar is just so much higher, that it is rare to have a really horrible experience with the food (especially if youâ€™re used to the standard American fare).

One dish you definitely should not miss is ramen. My first experience with ramen in Japan was exceptional. On our first day in Tokyo, we ended up knocking out in the afternoon due to jetlag. By the time we woke up, it was already dinner time. Even though we were in a semi-delirious state, we knew we had to make the most of the trip. Hence, we wandered out into the crowded, neon-lit streets and found ourselves at Ichiran, a popular ramen chain. When the ramen arrived and I took my first sip of the broth, the flavor hit me so hard that I actually thought: "_wow, so this is what umami tastes like_". All I can recall now from the rest of the meal is how happy that bowl of ramen made me feel.

Admittedly, the sequence of events that led up to that ramen moment was the perfect setup and I can't say the same will happen to you, but if you are on the fence about going to Japan, just go. Start with Tokyo as it is the gateway city. It definitely will change your perspective and maybe your life as it did mine.
