> The social media generation. No place on Earth is safe from the new world trekkers anymore. With just a little bit of searching, hidden gems become exposed and ripe for the picking. By writing this post, I have shamelessly become part of the problem. Oh well. This is the case with Havasu Falls and the Havasupai reservation. This gem of a place was probably unbeknownst to many people just ten years ago. Now, the most difficult part of getting to Havasupai is not the ten-mile hike, but obtaining a permit. Luckily, we were able to secure our permits nine months before the trip and got the rare chance to visit this literal oasis.

Words still under construction.
