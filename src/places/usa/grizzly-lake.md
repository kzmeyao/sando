> For those of us who are familiar with the Californian wilderness, we often associate granite mountains and pristine lakes with Yosemite, Tahoe, or basically any other scenic area in proximity to the Sierra Nevadas. In the oft-overlooked Trinity Alps Wilderness, however, a brilliant glacial lake called Grizzly Lake impresses all visitors. It is just as or even more charming than its eastern counterparts.

This was my first backpacking trip and there were definitely a lot of unknowns heading into this trip. The trail was front-loaded by a very steep hill, and it was quite challenging to get to the top carrying all of our gear with us. Fortunately, we arrived at the trailhead during sunset, so we ended up doing that first section in the cool darkness with our headlamps guiding the way. Not being able to see anything except for the trail in front of us also made the incline seem much shorter than it actually was.

The second most challenging section of the hike was the final mile-long scramble of granite rocks immediately under the lake. With frequent breaks, we had to inch up the scramble like little ants, sometimes resorting to climbing on all-fours to obtain better balance and grip. After overcoming that challenge, all of our fatigue quickly dissipated as we were treated to the very unique-looking Grizzly Fall gushing out of a wall of granite. And behind that wall, Grizzly Lake revealed itself like a desert mirage.

It felt like paradise after the trial we just put ourselves through. The lake water was three shades of blue, pristine, and best of all, we had it all to ourselves. Although we were only able to stay there for a couple of hours, we felt that the exceptional reward was well-worth the grueling hike. Someday, I know I will come back to this hidden gem and experience it all over again.
