For those of us familiar with the Californian wilderness, we often associate granite mountains and pristine lakes with Yosemite, Tahoe, or basically any other scenic area in proximity to the Sierra Nevadas. In the oft-overlooked Trinity Alps Wilderness, however, a brilliant glacial lake called Grizzly Lake impresses all visitors. It is just as charming than its eastern counterparts.

This was my first backpacking trip ever. The trail was front-loaded by a very steep hill. Fortunately, we arrived at the trailhead during sunset, so we ended up doing this first section in the cool darkness with our headlamps guiding the way. Not being able to see anything except for the trail in front of us actually made the incline seem much shorter than it actually was.

As we hiked deeper into the mountains, the vegetation became quite lush. The sounds of a stream turned into a rushing river that ran parallel to the trail for a while. There were also some waterfalls along the way, foreshadowing the purity of the glacial waters that was in store for us.

At the end of the trail, we took a brief break to relax and set up camp. The most challenging section of the trip was just up ahead- a final mile-long scramble of granite rocks immediately under the lake. Even without our gear, we took frequent breaks and inched up the scramble like little ants, sometimes resorting to climbing on all-fours to obtain better balance and grip.

After that ordeal, however, all of our fatigue quickly dissipated as we were treated to the very unique-looking Grizzly Fall gushing out of a wall of granite. And behind that wall, Grizzly Lake revealed itself like a desert mirage.

It felt like paradise after the trial we just put ourselves through. The lake water was three shades of blue, pristine, and best of all, we had it all to ourselves. Although we were only able to stay there for a couple of hours before sunset, we felt that the exceptional reward was well-worth the grueling scramble.

After spending the night back down at our camp, we kept our heads down and trekked the gruesome path back to our car. The trailhead sign greeted us once again and we slowly merged ourselves back into the land of computers, smartphones and In-N-Out.
