      In Japan, `sando` is short for sandwich. Also in Japan, I joined the cult
      of the humble egg salad sando after just one bite. Its simplicity, taste,
      and value just can't be beat. It's probably not even a stretch to say that
      my love for travel came after having that said bite. So here I am, writing
      this travel journal / travel guide, and I can't think of a better name for
      it than to name it after the perfect food.

      I'm a software engineer by trade, but I'm also a serial dabbler. My
      curiosity often leads me down rabbitholes and I spend an inordinate amount
      of time learning and doing something until I find something new to take
      its place. For example, I've composed songs while learning to play guitar,
      made the first scene of a JRPG while learning how to do pixel art, built a
      digital 3d model of a house while dreaming of eventually designing my own
      house. Even building this site happened on a whim, but who knows, maybe I
      will never get tired of photography and continue this project
      indefinitely.
