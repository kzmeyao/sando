      On my first trip to Japan, I ended up joining the cult of the humble egg
      salad sando after just one bite. For the uninitiated, `sando` is short for
      sandwich, and the egg salad sando is the perfect sandwich. Its simplicity,
      taste, and value just can't be beat. It's probably not even a stretch to
      say that my love for travel came after having that said bite. So here I
      am, writing this travel journal / travel guide, and I can't think of a
      better name for it than to name it after the thing that started it all.

      I'm a software engineer by trade, but I'm also a serial dabbler. My
      curiosity often leads me down creative rabbitholes and I spend an
      inordinate amount of time learning and making something until I find
      another new thing to take its place. For example, I've composed songs
      while learning to play guitar, made the first scene of a JRPG while
      learning how to draw pixel art, 3d-modeled a house while dreaming of
      eventually designing my own house. Come to think of it, even building this
      site happened on a whim - here's hoping that it'll last.
